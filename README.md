A password generator is a tool that creates secure passwords by randomly selecting uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters based on user input. It ensures uniqueness and complexity, making it harder to crack. Users define character distribution, and the generator shuffles them for randomness. 
  **🔹 Key Features of a Password Generator**
✔️ **Randomized Characters** → Avoids predictable patterns  
✔️ **User Input for Customization** → Defines length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols  
✔️ **Character Mixing** → Ensures variety for stronger passwords  
✔️ **Security Enhancement** → Reduces the risk of brute force attacks 

 **🔹 How It Works?**
1️⃣ **User specifies the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters**  
2️⃣ **The program randomly selects characters from predefined sets** (ASCII letters, digits, symbols)  
3️⃣ **All characters are combined and shuffled to enhance randomness**  
4️⃣ **The final password is displayed**
